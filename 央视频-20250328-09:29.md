__About how strong these government's cases are against these academics.__

This is what the problem is. You know, uh, the cornerstone of our constitution is, in fact, freedom of speech, freedom of association. And these students have been detained on allegations of their support and for basically exercising their freedom
of speech. So what we have here is that the administration is going as far as the teeny beast individuals and preventing them from exercising the constitutional. Right? so It is true that these individuals are here as either on student visas or are lawful permanent residents, but they still enjoy these freedoms of our constitution. We are talking about the cornerstone of what our country was founded on it. So this is really concerning.

__so Ana Luisa, can the trump administration continue to do to detain individuals, students, and academics who may have an opposing viewpoint from this administration? what what What laws have they have they broken?__

so Here's the thing um We know us citizens enjoy all the rights of the constitution. Lawful permanent residents and individuals in the United States do as well. But with limitations and the limitations is immigration law. So if the government is going to institute to a deportation proceedings for these individuals, they have to follow the law, the immigration law. We're talking about the rule of law. So there's a procedure for that. The administration needs to file allegations and charges against these individuals and he needs to follow the process. It needs to be before a judge who will determine what evidence the government has in order to institute the deportation proceedings from these individuals and how to strip them from their status, whether that is a visa or lawful permanent residence.
Now, lawful permanent residents would enjoy higher you know more rights than somebody who's here on a on a visa. But there is a process for doing this. And that's what the government needs to do.so In the case of this Iranian national Ali residue, Rudi from University of Alabama, no reason was given no charges have been filed, we know absolutely nothing in his case.
Right? and This is what we need to question and this is what is going to be resolved in the courts because that is what needs to happen if the government is intending of removing an individual who is lawfully in this country pursuant to an admission has been vetted.

This individual applied for a visa was admitted the government has vetted them. And now they want to revoke that status. They need to follow the procedure that the government itself has to establish and so this will be the determine in the court in the court of law.

Are they doing that? Are they following the legal process or the procedure, as you say?
Got, That is the problem. And that is the bigger issue at hand here with what this administration is doing. Because if we are talking about the rule of law, it is not only individuals who need to follow the rule of law, but our government needs to follow our group.Our rule of law. That's why we have the constitution. That's why we have laws. And so it is up to the attorneys. It is up to the courts to really ensure that this government. Is following what we stand for I mean what country. Are we becoming if we are not 
continuing to be the corner of that democracy, the cornerstone of who we are as a country,
 all right, An important conversation there. Ana Luis. Sap idea. Thank you.

Echoes is consistent vision, reinforcing the foreign's mission to foster dialogue and cooperation in uncertain times that icgtn WOW 
French president Emmanuel Macron hosted a Ukraine summit in Paris, and Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelinsky was among those leaders
president of the summit.
Obviously, the gathering was seen as a show of unity for. Keith macron also announced that Britain and France would send military advisers to Ukraine in the coming days. Ross Cullen has the latest from Paris.
well The news that a team of military advisers will travel to. Ukraine is a sign that Britain and France want to maintain the momentum behind their plan to potentially send thousands of troops to support Ukraine in what the French president has. Described as a dissuasive military capacity to deter any further future. Russian aggression in a deployment that would only take place after an eventual peace agreement is signed. He said the themes of military representatives will be assessing ongoing support and training for the Ukrainian armed forces.But they would also be there to examine what kind of equipment might be needed by the so called reassurance force. And the total number of soldiers who will be deployed by what's been described as the coalition of the willing.
The French president also argued against easing any restrictions on Russia at the moments on 
terms of Susan COSTA made Ukraine in 
terms of short term support for Ukraine. We ought to unanimously agreed that the time is not yet right for lifting sanctions of any kind.
There can be no policy of sanction relief, but for peace is clearly established. We therefore intend to maintain economic pressure, particularly on ghost fleets and certain industrial capacities. We will continue to focus our efforts on this.
The British prime minister also spoke following the conclusion of the summits on Thursday. Kia stamer said that there were strong resolve among all the allies who gathered in the Elysee Palace that countries should be increasing sanctions on Russia now to force Moscow to to the negotiating table, Europe mobilizing together behind the peace process,on a scale that we haven't seen for decades,backed my partners from around the world.
We are determined to deliver a just and lasting peace,because we know that it is vital for Ukraine and Europe as a whole.and I am clear,but it's also vital for Britain.The summits was a useful opportunity for Ukraine's allies to continue to align their positions and demonstrate a united front. But the United States was absent, although Emmanuel Macron did speak to President Trump on the telephone before the summit began. Several western nations feel that Washington's role is critical, both in providing Europe and Ukraine with security guarantees to deter Russia in the future, but also in the peace negotiations that they have recently started with Moscow.Ross Cullen, cgtn, Paris.
Now, let's take a look at the reaction to this summit from Moscow. Our correspondent Dutch attorney Schober reports.
Indeed, Russia believes that any potential deployment of NATO troops under a plan of the proposed so called coalition of the will in Ukraine will inevitably leads to the direct confrontation between Moscow and uh these countries. And this is a scenario area that Moscow says it completely rejects. That's according to Russia's foreign ministry. Spokeswoman Mahdi, as a harder who has been speaking at a news briefing on Thursday in Moscow. And she also has noted that it is the UK and France that are pushing forward with these ideas.and Also, they say uh here in Russia that these ideas are actually laying ground for potential military intervention by those countries into Ukraine.
Again. Moscow says these are the militaristic spirits in Europe that are not conducive to any sort of negotiated settlement in Ukraine. And they are very contrary to the position of the United States and to the efforts that Russia and the us are now taking. Moscow insists that the European countries are trying to continue the fighting in Ukraine they are encouraged jin Kiev to continue uh the ongoing a fight in a while. Moscow says it is also possible that this will undermine any peace initiatives that have been undertaken by Russia and the United States.
Thus, attorneys over reporting.Israel says it has intercepted two missiles launched from Yemen before they entered Israeli territory. No injuries were reported the attempted strikes prompted air raid sirens throughout Israel, including Jerusalem.Yemen, Iranian backed who these have been attacking Israel for more than a year and commercial vessels in the Red Sea as a show of support of Palestinians in Gaza.
The us has responded with strikes on their strongholds in Yemen.Hamas says its spokesperson has been killed in an Israeli airstrike in northern Gaza. It comes 2 weeks after Israel resumed its attacks which have killed hundreds of Palestinians and hit un facilities.Rami alma Gotti reports.
For me,
the International Committee of the Red Cross confirmed that one of its officers in Rafael southern Gaza sustained damage from an Israeli explosive shell.On Monday,although no casualties were reported a spokesperson for the Red Cross emphasized that their ability to carry out a humanitarian work has been severely hindered due to the prevailing insecurity.
We are extremely 
uh shocked and be extremely decry the attack against our premises in Rafael allocation that we have been existing since there since October 23
uh Providing urgently needed assistance for the impacted civilians by this conflict and these these premises as as the same as all the icfc premises in Gaza Strip,is notified well known for all parties.
And there's an ICRC flag on the rooftop of our building, 
as well as ongoing bombardment across Gaza since last week has resulted in the deaths of more than 750 Palestinians.The strikes have also targeted vital infrastructure, including NASA hospital and happiness southern Gaza.
While this can jumble sorry, there 
is no safety here even hospitals are being bombed. Nowhere safe not in the streets, not institutions, not even international organizations. They have no red lines. They bomb when ever they want.
Last week our nearest strike on aun facility in general Bella central Gaza killed aun staff member and wounded five others.Additionally,two Palestinian journalists were killed and subsequent Israeli airstrikes,
reminding everyone about their obligations toward the international humanitarian law that guarantees the safety and security and protection for civilians, for the medical staff and missions structures, as well as for the humanitarian personnel who are endangering their lives and trying to 
which those in need,
the una spokesperson confirmed that the strike on the un facility in central Gaza last week was caused by an Israeli tank shell.
The International Committee of the Red Cross office and rapper has been hit by Israeli shelling.It's the second such attack in recent days following an early strike on aun facility and central Gaza that killed an international staff member.These incidents under is called the grim reality in Gaza were nowhere is a truly safe for Palestinians or foreign aid workers.Ramirez, Marie, cgtn,the southern Gaza Strip,
nearly 30 have died in South Korea's biggest and deadliest wildfires on record. They've been burning for a week, destroying hundreds of buildings and forcing thousands to evacuate others, grapple with the loss of their homes.Been harm has the latest.
Dozens of people have taken shelter at this gymnasium after being forced to flee their homes. Many evacuees arrived with very little escaping as flames tore through their neighborhoods and villages.
Like 77 year old Kim Wesson, who fled her home with literally nothing but the clothes on her back. 
I 
didn't even have time to think about it when they told us to evacuate, I just ran out wearing slippers without even grab.
Having my sneakers, I had nowhere to go. So now I'm staying here. Shelters 
like this. One have been set up across the region for people like Kim who lost their homes, offering food, blankets, medical care and other basic needs.Volunteers, local businesses and aid organizations are working around the clock to provide support.
I think is that I'm going to soon as a girl here, I focused on how to greet and comfort evacuees, especially the elderly. I wanted to help them feel safe and reassured by the time I arrived, the place was already packed with people.
So I went around, calming them one by one. I told them it's okay, you're safe here. Don't worry. The fire won't reach you, just reassuring them like that.We are here, so you will be fine.
This evacuation center is full of people who have no idea when or if they'll be able to return home. Many are worried about what comes next, but for now their focus is on getting through each night with the support of volunteers and emergency workers.Meanwhile, firefighting crews continue to battle the flames under dangerous conditions. Strong winds and dry weather have made containment efforts extremely difficult. All the while evacuees tried to remain optimistic at a time when all hope seems lost.
What you don't care about. We 
work a true love of my life working hard and never imagined this would happen. But now there's no hope.
South Korea is currently battling one of its worst wildfires in history.For many at this shelter, the hope is that the sooner the flames are extinguished, the sooner this community can start to rebuild and rekindle its spirits.
