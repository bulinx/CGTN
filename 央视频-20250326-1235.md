### News 1

Security breach, it breaks many laws, including about disclosure and transparency, and it just, you know, it lays bare internal divisions within the cabinets between bands.
So the president, then back chatting like this, is certainly not going to go well with Donald Trump. And it's another blow to transatlantic relations to question Trump and his appointee's ability to govern.
And I know about the APP. They're using the signal, uh, according to some tech insiders, that this platform is used by this group. Chad has better privacy features compared with other instant uh messaging apps. But I think we should put a question Mark here. Now how secure is it?
Dong Ming singles a private messaging APP that offers text messaging, voice, video, and file sharing. It's free, anonymous, end-to-end encryption and minimal data collection. And I think this is the key part here.uh These messages can disappear at pictures, you send disappear, files you sent disappear. So it's already on a list of government of unapproved apps because it has been allegedly hacked by other countries you know using it violates not only these laws but you know this issue of transparency.
Remember uh you know, all the attacks on Hillary Clinton because of all those emails disappearing and Donald Trump calling for you know a full investigation. One wonders if he will be doing the same when it's his appointees violating the same ideas.
well uh Mister tango. It looks like this is also a wake up call for the Europeans because from the report published by the Atlantic magazine, we can see some quite harsh words against Europe in that group. Chad, for example, officials call them free loaders.They debated making them pay the us for strikes on Yemen. What do you make of the possible ripple effects across the Atlantic if not a tsunami in the Intelligence circle?
well you you You already covered the fact that there has been some reaction by European capitals uh talking variously about uh the need to be independent, a wake up call, but others saying, oh no, we'll we'll continue sharing information
uh Basically the eu and the separate from Europe as a whole is divided.you know their Their options are pretty small. They can appease trump and wait for 4 years and hopefully you know something changes.But you know there's this real issue about the United States and its reliability.This does not help or the other option is take the on the economic and military risk of separating from the United States. But that will take time a whole lot of money at a time when the eu and Europe are struggling with the economic consequences.This is of the war in Ukraine and a slow down in their ability to produce.
Right? I know I'd like to continue to follow on the relations between us and its a traditional allies. 
uh the We've got some responses as we just reported from European leaders. Chias. Sharma said, no, we're good.Going to despite all that, we're going to continue to share information with the us in the Middle East, but other some other leaders such as the ah like what we just report the Belgium prime minister said, well it's the time for uh for us to wake up and to set up a real European defense. What do you make of those responses? Do you think that it is seriously jeopardizing us relations with its traditional allies.
well there's There's only so many hammer blows to the European relationship that can be taken before. you know People, as the as said, have to wake up.I mean uh JD Vance is uh speech in Europe really caught people by surprise.
These are things that may you may say in private, um but you certainly do not put them on display.So you know there's a real breakdown in trust. Ii it's really hard to imagine how Europe can recover from this. They might say, as as I said before, they can outweigh trump.But the the book ends for America have been set and uh reset. I should say I mean they they have drifted farther, right? And you know Americans are very concerned about anyone coming in very isolationist, a very nativist. And you know trump is taking it even further. And Elon Musk, what they're doing in South Africa,you know Europe looks at what happened to Canada, and they're horrified here. Here's a nation that you know literally almost blindly follows the us and every kind of foreign escapade, a war, et cetera, that has been a trusted ally and friend, uh a trade partner.
And it's treated like it's some sort of pariah.so you know If they treat your your closest ally and neighbor like this, Europe does not have any sense that it will, in fact, be treated any differently.
All right, thank you very much. I know tongue.He is a fellow senior fellow at Taihe institute,
real breakdown and trust I.
By the president, I will continue their duties until a new chancellor is sworn in. Peter Oliver reports from Berlin.
The 630 members of the new German parliament took up their seats on Tuesday in the Bundestag just behind me. Friedrich Metz and his conservative bloc are still trying to thrash out a coalition deal between themselves and the social Democratic Party. 
So we're still at little while away from having a government here, the Bundestag sessions or the largest block of far right lawmakers and a German parliament since 1945 alternative for Deutschland.Afd doubled their seats in February's election and will be the largest opposition group in this parliament.It didn't take long for the far right party to voice its displeasure at how members feel they are being treated by the status quo.Afd. Parliamentary leader Bernd Baumann was furious that longest serving member of the Bundestag Gregor Giese of the left party was named father of the house over afd. Chairman Alexander goland,who had 84 years old is the oldest the rules were changed in 2017 to stop a situation whereby an Afghan member would open parliament. The opening of the new Bundestag came on the same day as outgoing chancellor Olaf Schultz and his cabinet received their official letters of dismissal from the German president.
They will remain in post in a caretaker capacity until a new government is formed. Something Friedrick Metz says he wants to see happen before Easter.Peter Oliver cgtn Berlin.
Brazil's Supreme Court is deliberating on whether to put former president Nigeria boss narrow on trial, but so narrow and seven others have been accused of several crimes, including attempting a coup.The former president faces a possible sentence of 30 years or more in prison if found guilty, Paula Cabrera reports.
The charges against former president charitable sonata and savan associates are being heard in the Supreme Court are centered around an alleged attempt of a coup that ah which culminated in the attacks on Brazil's main seats of power on January 8 20 20 3, the mob of
sonata supporters had been camping at the doorsteps of military facilities since the electoral victory of president Louisiana Sulu, da Silva demanding a military intervention.
Try to say 
Alexander garland who had 84 years old is the oldest the rules were changed in 2017 to stop a situation whereby an afd member would open parliament the opening of the new Bundestag 
image on public property and destruction of protected public property.
But federal prosecutor Paolo Gandhi said the story began 2.5 years before the dramatic events of January 8th when president Bosa narrow escalated his public attacks on Brazil's electoral system on July 29th, 2021.
Wilsonado chose to attend the Supreme Court proceedings in person even though his presence 
was not mandatory.
There is 
nothing in the federal police inquiry to actually substantiate the allegations that are being made against me.The former president's lawyer did admit that unlawful events may have taken place but denied both scenarios, participation or approval,doing things by graphic dodgy.
I understand the seriousness of everything that happened on January 8th, but we cannot say the president was responsible for this and that he was leading a criminal organization when he did not have any participation in the January 8th events.
On the contrary, he repudiated them 
why oboe sonatas, legal team fights for this case against decline to be dismissed by the Supreme Court. His political allies are also on the move trying to push through congress a bill granting amnesty to all those accused of taking part in the January 8th riots botswanaro called for a rally in Hugo Shapiro to show support for the amnesty plan but a low turnout compared to previous protests by his supporters suggests little public interest in the idea.
Share of ukluk, it's obvious that there's further weakens both scenarios, prospects for power. Let's remember, first, Botswana was defeated by Lula in the elections.Then he was there from participating in elections for electoral crimes. And now prosecutor garnet charges him criminally based on a robust inquiry of the federal police.
The Supreme Court proceedings to decide what's next for both sonata will continue on Wednesday when a decision is expected, most analysts here say they expect the former president will stand trial

and The us special envoy says Washington is developing a strategy to support the Caribbean nation's police and Haitian police and international security forces have been able to fend off guns in some areas but to have not contained the violence.Harold Isaac reports from Port au Prince 
Haiti is in the grip of one of its worst crises in recent history. Armed groups have tightened their control over large parts of the capital port, au Prince and beyond leaving millions trapped in a cycle of violence, displacement and economic despair
The political landscape remains fragile with the transitional presidential council struggling to assert its authority amid infighting and 
public distrust. We have nowhere to go all of those sleeping at the gas station have nowhere to go.
I just have one thing to say to the government. They have to do something for us.
The United Nations says the security crisis has forced over 1 million people in total to flee their homes.With a sharp increase in displacements seen last year, humanitarian agencies say about half of the population is facing acute food shortages.Many displaced citizens have sought refuge in makeshift shelters with little access to food, water or medical care. Yet gang violence continues to escalate with kidnappings, extortion and killings pushing the country, especially the metropolitan area of Port au Prince further into turmoil.
So here in downtown Port au Prince, gang violence is around the corner and constantly threatening the remaining functioning parts of the city
